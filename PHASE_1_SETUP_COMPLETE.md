## Important Notes

### 🎯 Phase 1 Approach
- **MVP First**: Get something working before optimizing
- **Quality First**: Tests before features
- **Document Everything**: Future reference
- **Review Points**: Pause and assess at each milestone
- **Flexibility**: Adjust if needed, but document changes

### ⚠️ Known Constraints
- Performance targets are **relaxed** for MVP:
  - 100ms → 200ms cold start (Phase 1)
  - 50MB → 100MB memory (Phase 1)
  - This allows focus on correctness

- Some features are **Phase 2+**:
  - TOC extraction
  - Fuzzy search
  - Bookmarks
  - Better layout preservation

- Image rendering is **Phase 3**:
  - Not in Phase 1 MVP
  - Planned for future

### 🔄 Iterative Nature
This is **not** a fixed plan:
- Adjust based on what you learn
- Document any changes
- Extend milestones if needed
- Can revisit earlier milestones

### Q: Should I read all documents first?

**A**: Not necessary. Start with:
1. This file (context)
2. PHASE_1_INDEX.md (overview)
3. Then dive into Milestone 1.1

### Q: Can I skip milestones?

**A**: Not recommended. Each builds on previous:

- 1.2: Measure performance
- 1.3: Fix issues found in 1.2
- 1.4: Optimize based on 1.2 measurements
- 1.5: Ensure quality
- 1.6: Document and prepare

### Q: What if I get stuck?

**A**: Document in the milestone review:
- What were you trying?
- What error occurred?
- What have you tried?
- Ask for help/clarification

### Q: How long will Phase 1 take?

**A**: 3-5 weeks depending on:
- How many bugs found in 1.3
- Performance issues in 1.4
- How much documentation needed in 1.6

Average case: 4 weeks

### Q: Should I commit to git?

**A**: Yes, after each milestone:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Phase 1 Milestone X.Y complete"
```
